I am an aspiring and ambitious full stack junior developer looking for a role where I can expand and consolidate my programming knowledge.  I also want to gain more exposure to project management and work in the tech industry as part of a team to grow myself and others in this industry. 

After completing my BSc(Hons) in Mathematics at the University of Sussex, I spent two years working for an engineering company that specialised in industrial machinery for production line processes in paper, textiles, steel and automotive industries. This experience allowed me to develop excellent communication skills, as well as implement project management and leadership and to appreciate all aspects of a business from the ground up.

My time after this has been spent aspiring to expand my knowledge on coding and in doing so have been learning to code at Makers Academy, a highly selective and intensive 16 week software development bootcamp.

**Tech Skills** : ReactJS, Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL

## Skills

#### Excellent communicator

During my employment, I communicated regularly with customers internationally, this included telephone conversations, emails and meeting face to face with new and existing clientele.  I utilised this ability on many occasions during my employment, one especially was during ITMA(International Textile Machinery Association), Milan 2015 where I represented Richard Hough Limited for 2 weeks on our own exhibition unit meeting hundreds of clients both old and new over the duration, acquiring new business leads and maintaining relationships.  This skill has proved useful during my learning at Makers Academy as it has enabled me to build up instant rapport with my fellow colleagues and allowed open communication while pairing on coding projects to keep learning on track to complete the task at hand. This has been evidenced by the successful group [projects](#projects) I have had the pleasure of working on while at Makers Academy, such as HabiChat and MakersBnB.

#### Adaptable

I have worked around the world -- including being deployed to China, Austria, Czech Republic, Germany and Turkey -- with a large diversity of cultures and people.  New environments, new languages, new challenges; both in the workplace and during my software development education.  These opportunities have been incredibly useful to learn and grow.

#### Attention to detail

I have always excelled at solving a problem, be that from my experience at University or learning at Makers Academy. With this I have developed a keen eye for detail which has been incredibly useful, be it solving mathematical equations at university or finding that one bug in the code.

#### Enthusiastic attitude

I am a happy, confident and positive person.  I like to show that through my personality and through the pride I take in my work.  I like to think that this attitude helps me accomplish the task at hand, remain focussed and also help others around me.  I have found this very useful while pair partnering with others to work on our code.

## Experience

**Richard Hough Limited** (Jun'14 - Jul'16)    
*Business Development Manager*
As the Business Development Manager I was tasked with learning the needs and requirements of both the company itself and its customers.  Communication and a thorough understanding of products and technical aspects were required to be successful in this role. I organised and attended exhibition events globally, was the point of contact for customers for maintaining and creating business relations and I was responsible for helping generate sales.

I worked within industry sectors such as Paper, Textiles, Steel and Automotive production lines.  These varying range of industries required me to understand individual tailored requirements for customers dependant on their companies needs.  This has helped me develop a critical eye for detail and see the bigger picture at hand. 

Some of the companies I worked with consisted of:

- Jaguar Landrover, Automotive (Birmingham)
- UPM Caledonian Paper, Paper (Scotland)
- Shanghai General Motors, Automotive (China)
- Getzner Textil AG, Textiles (Austria)
- Brigl & Bergmeister, Paper (Austria)
- Veba, Textiles (Czech Republic)
