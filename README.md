I am an aspiring and ambitious full stack junior developer whom is looking for a role where I can expand and consolidate my programming knowledge, while also gaining more exposure to project management and working in the tech industry as part of a team to grow myself and others in this industry.

After completeing my BSc(Hons) in Mathematics at the University of Sussex, I spent two years working for an engineering company whom specialised in industrial machinery for production line proccesses in paper, textiles, steel and automotive industies. This experience allowed me to develop my excellent communication skills, as well as implement project management and leadership and to really appreciate all aspects of a business from the ground up.

My time after this has been spent aspiring to expand my knowledge on coding and in doing so have been learning to code at Makers Academy, a highly selective and intensive 16 week software development bootcamp.

**Tech Skills** : Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL

#### Excellent communicator

During my time at Richard Hough Limited, I was tasked with communicating regularly with customers both in England and oversees, this included telephone conversations, emails and meeting face to face with new and existing clientel.  I utilised this ability on many occasions during my employment, one especially was during ITMA Milan 2015 where I represented Richard Hough Limited for 2 weeks during the exhibition meeting hundreds of clients both old and new over the duration, aquiring new buisness leads and maintaining relationships.  This skill has proved incredibly useful during my learning at Makers Academy as it has enabled me to build up instant repore with my fellow colleagues and allowed open communication while pairing on coding projects to keep our learning on track to complete the task at hand, this has been evidenced by the successful group projects I have had the pleasure of working on while at Makers Academy, such as HabiChat and MakersBnB.

#### Adaptable

I have worked around the world with a large diversity of cultures and people.  New environments, new languages, new challenges; both in the workplace and during my software development education.  None of these are problems, only opportunities to learn and grow.

#### Attention to detail

I have always enjoyed solving a problem, be that from my experience at University or learning at Makers Academy. With this I have developed a keen eye for detail which has been incredilby useful when it has come to solving mathematical equations at university, or finding that one bug in the code.

#### Positve attitude

I am a happy, confident and positive person.  I like to show that through my personality and through the pride I take in my work.  I like to think that this attitude helps myself to accomplish the task at hand, remain focussed and also help others around me in focusing in the same way.  I have found this very useful while pair partnering with others to work on our code.
